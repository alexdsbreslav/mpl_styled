# quicklook How-To
quicklook is written to be copied-and-pasted into your code. It makes visualization easy and lowers to barrier to creating attractive plots.
I use quicklook in JupyterLab (and Jupyter Notebook) and I wrote it with that user interface in mind.
If you do not already use JupyterLab and are interested in learning how, check out my [python_for_uxr tutorial](https://github.com/alexdsbreslav/python_for_uxr).

## Before you start...
[Right-click here](https://github.com/alexdsbreslav/quicklook/blob/master/how_to_use_quicklook/using_features_in_Jupyter.md) to open (in a new tab) a quick tutorial on using features in JupyterLab to copy-and-paste quicklook code.

## Step 1: Build a chart skeleton.
A **chart skeleton** is the background, title, axes, and axis labels. It is a skeleton (or wireframe, or background) that we will layer **plots** onto.
**Plots** are various ways that we can visualize data like line plots, bar plots, histograms, scatter plots etc.
- [Click here](https://github.com/alexdsbreslav/quicklook/blob/master/how_to_use_quicklook/build_chart_skeleton.md) to go to directions for building a chart skeleton.

## Step 2: Add plots to your chart skeleton to visualize your data.
Click on the links below to go to directions for that plot:
- Add a line plot to your chart
- Add a line plot (with error) to your chart
- Add a vertical line to your chart
- Add a horizontal line to your chart
- Add a scatter plot to your chart
- Add a scatter plot (with error) to your chart
- Add a histogram to your chart
- Add a bar plot to your chart

For each of these plots, you need to **choose colors**! Click here for directions of specifying colors in your plots.

## Step 3: Add text and/or a legend to provide context for your visualization.
Click on the links below to go to directions for that feature:
- Add a legend to your chart
- Add text to your chart

## Step 4: Export your plot.
