# How to use quicklook
quicklook **is a copy-and-paste** library that leverages Jupyter Notebooks user interface to make data visualization quick and efficient. 

## To start...
1. Import quicklook (as well as a few key packages into your notebook)
```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import quicklook as ql
```
Make sure you are familiar with two key Jupyter Notebook shortcuts:
1. Hitting `tab` after you type `ql.` will show you a dropdown of everything in quicklook.
2. Hitting `shift-tab` after you've entered a class name (e.g., `ql.chart_skeleton`) will show you the Docstring.

For every function in quicklook, you'll copy and paste the Docstring into your code!

## For each new chart that you want to create...
### Step 1: Build a chart skeleton.
A **chart skeleton** is the background, title, axes, and axis labels. It is a skeleton (or wireframe, or background) that we will layer **plots** onto.
**Plots** are various ways that we can visualize data like line plots, bar plots, histograms, scatter plots etc.

### Step 2: Add plots to your chart skeleton to visualize your data.

- [Add a scatter plot to your chart skeleton](https://github.com/alexdsbreslav/quicklook/blob/master/how_to_use_quicklook/add_scatter_plot.md)
- [Add a distribution plot to your chart skeleton](https://github.com/alexdsbreslav/quicklook/blob/master/how_to_use_quicklook/add_distribution_plot.md)
- [Add a bar plot to your chart skeleton](https://github.com/alexdsbreslav/quicklook/blob/master/how_to_use_quicklook/add_bar_plot.md)

### Step 3: Add a legend, text, and/or reference lines that provide important information about your visualization.

### Optional: Save chart to your computer.
Most of the time, my charts live within my Jupyter Notebooks. Sometimes you may want to save your chart to your computer so that you put them in slides or share them with colleagues.
