Check out the documentation by clicking [here](https://github.com/alexdsbreslav/quicklook/tree/master/how_to_use_quicklook) or by navigating to the folder `how_to_use_quicklook`.

## Updated version coming soon!
I am currently overhauling my data visualization package to (1) make it easier to use, (2) adding functionality that I (and I imagine many) data scientists want, and (3) creating a slide template in Figma and Google Slides so that your slides and data visualization all look amazing together.

## Why quicklook?
Creating attractive, ready-to-share data visualizations takes forever. quickook is a cut-and-paste Python package that does the design work for you and makes it easy to create beautifuly simple data visualizations.

## Who is quicklook best for?
quicklook is for any data scientist, product manager, or researcher that knows a little bit of Python and is analyzing their data in a Jupyter Notebook. My goal in writing quicklook was to make data viz more efficient, but in the process, I've also created a package that is easy to use for beginners.

## To install...
Directions to come; I am currently overhauling the package and will upload to pip for easy installation.

## Documentation
The [documentation is here](https://github.com/alexdsbreslav/quicklook/tree/master/how_to_use_quicklook), but it's outdated. I am currently overhauling the package!
