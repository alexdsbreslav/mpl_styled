# quicklook
quicklook is a Python package for visualizing data quickly.

## Why quicklook?
My name is Alex. I am a cognitive scientist and quantitative user researcher; you can check out my [LinkedIn here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexanderbreslav/). I taught myself how to code during my PhD. As I was learning, data visualization posed a big problem. I constantly needed to visualize data, but creating visualizations that were attractive, easy-to-read, and shareable took forever. 

I started writing quicklook to solve my own data visualization problems and I wanted to share my progress with others. I am not a engineer, I do not have formal CS training, and this is the first and only package that I've written. Please check it out, send me feedback (alexdsbreslav@gmail.com), and let me know if I can make updates to help you solve your data visualization challenges!

**The goal of quicklook is to create an easy way for users to make attractive, easy-to-read, and immediately shareable visualizations for their everyday analyses.** 

## Who is quicklook best for?
This package is written for **researchers that have limited experience programming in Python**. I remember looking at documentaton for matplotlib, seaborn, bokeh, plotly etc. and being completely confused. quicklook aims to solve this problem; I want you to be able to visualize your data in Python without the incredibly time-consuming learning curve.

In quicklook, I do my best to keep the language, examples, and documentation accessible for people just learning how to code.

**To use quicklook, you'll need to know the basics of Python and Jupyter Notebooks.**

## Still learning Python or how to use Jupyter Notebooks? 
[Check out my python_for_uxr tutorial](https://github.com/alexdsbreslav/python_for_uxr)! This tutorial is designed specifically for researchers interested in learning how to code.

## To install...
1. Open Jupyter Lab
2. Open a terminal
3. Type `pip install git+git://github.com/alexdsbreslav/quicklook.git` and hit enter!

## Acknowledgments
quicklook is built using [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/), [NumPy](https://numpy.org/), [Open Color](https://yeun.github.io/open-color/), and [seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/).
